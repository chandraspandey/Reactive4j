 * Defines optional Exemption mechanism from sequential policy/ruleset execution. 
 * Implementation class provides concrete implementation of short circuit 
 * mechanism. During execution if preceeding rule provides a Deterministic 
 * Result due to which succeeding rule validation is rendered redundant and 
 * need not be performed.
 * It models the flow instrumentation of IF THEN WHAT execution policy.
 * Exemption is optionally bounded with ScheduleCalendar as a data type where
 * expiry of exemption is necessary such as Security.
